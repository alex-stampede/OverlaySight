#OverlaySight

OverlaySight is a lightweight macOS always-on-top overlay utility that allows you to place a simple crosshair or dot on top of any application.

This project was built as a personal SwiftUI experiment focused on transparent windows, window levels, and minimal UI design on macOS.
It is intentionally simple, fast, and distraction-free.
